## Overview

Yin Yang is a board game of pawns where the rules of combat and development are
set by the players themselves. Dominos are used to secretly define the laws of
evolution and are then played like cards.

## Purpose

I want to make this game live in website, to be able to play it whenever I want.
I will learn Scala, Play framework, NoSQL (through Redis), Bootstrap, and so on.

## Current version

The current version is alpha !

Take care that may kill kitties and bring the apocalypse.

 
## System requirements

 * [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com/) : 2.2.1

## Quick start

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Isammoc/yinyang.git
$ cd yinyang
$ play run
```

open your browser to `http://localhost:9000`

## Run the tests

```bash
$ play test
```

## Copying

I currently did not found a license I like. I will come and change this when I
find one.
I know this project will be free (as freedom) and I wonder about the WTFPL

## Contribute

You may fork, hack, and request a merge.
Please explain what you have done (and why).

You may create issues to help me know what doesn't work (but I already know that
not so much works... It is alpha version after all).
